Programming is the language with which every website, mobile app, and even toasters are built with. It’s the esperanto of our days[1]. Design is a way to find creative solutions to problems by exploring the problematic, building & testing prototypes, receiving feedback and iterating. In past jobs we’ve seen how these two don’t always seem to understand each other, to say the least. If we want to solve complex problems, that affect people with different backgrounds, interests and goals, in an ever more interconnected and technological world, there has to be a good conversation between code and design.

When coders and designers do their jobs uncoordinatedly, it’s a recipe for disaster. If designers are unfamiliar with the way technology works, the result is often an impractical solution, that in the best case scenario, doesn’t take advantage of the particularities of the technology is running on. On the other hand, when programmers are unfamiliar with design, they tend to build a machine that solves a problem that no one has.

If you still think design is “just the looks”, it’s time to give it a second chance, because it’s much more.

* Has your new internal project failed to gain wide adoption with your co-workers?
* Has your brand failed to gain support in your target audience?
* Are your users not behaving the way you expected them to?
* Is your shopping cart drop-rate too high?

If any of this ring a bell to you, then you have either been solving the wrong problem or crafted the wrong solution. In either case you are in the domain of design.

Since Tim Brown popularized the term design thinking in his book Change by Design, many companies have seen the value in approaching problems from the design perspective and have integrated into their business processes. Google went one step further and created a formal framework around it: Design Sprint. They define it as “a framework for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with users.”[2]. In a nutshell, what design thinking, or their incarnations such us design sprint, gives teams is a process that help them find solutions. They achieve this by collaboratively and inexpensively, designing experiments aimed at learning as quickly as possible, if a proposed solution is feasible, understandable and will ultimate benefit customers. Sometimes this process will yield a solution and sometimes you’ll find that you are solving the wrong problem in the first place. Back to the drawing board.

At GuidePost we believe that this way of working makes every team member responsible for designing and achieving the best solution. Everyone has a duty to put their unique perspective forward but also has to listen respectfully to what others have to say, focusing on their strengths and not on their limitations. By creating structured instances where everyone’s voice is heard, you not only create a team and company culture, where people actually want to work with, you reach solutions that not a single member could have come up on its own. Oh... and by the way, it makes your days at work much more fun too.
