We haven't decided yet from which co-work we'll be working in Bangkok where we are staying for 10 days before going to China for a month. We need to find time to visit the places we want to visit, go to a thai cooking class and study for the [online courses][product] we are [enrolled in][crypto]. We have meetings in London, Sydney & Santiago timezones with our clients. Oh, and in two more week, we will become Estonia e-residents.

I've got to be honest, I hate the term "digital nomad". It's one of those terms that is used and over used to the point where words loose their meaning, but then again, I think it perfectly describe our lifestyle at the moment. Computer, cellphone, credit cards & backpacks.

That's the Digital Nomad lifestyle.
